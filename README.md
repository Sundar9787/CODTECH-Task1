### Objective
This repository contains the code and analysis for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of men's perfumes listed on eBay. The goal is to explore the dataset, understand its structure, and visualize various aspects to gain insights.

### Key Activities
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to understand data distributions, trends, and relationships.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying correlations between population figures across different years.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: Employed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**: Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.

### Key Insights
- **Population Distributions**: Histograms to show how populations have been distributed over time.
- **Inter-year Relationships**: Scatter plots to reveal relationships between population data from different years.
- **Correlation Patterns**: Heatmaps to display the correlation between populations over the years, highlighting significant trends and patterns.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of global population trends and insights, useful for further studies or policy-making related to demographic changes.
